I'm still experiencing a critical issue with the tab drag and drop system - nothing happens when I drop a tab. It just returns to its original position. This suggests there's a fundamental problem with the drop event handling.

Please perform a thorough debugging and fix of the drag and drop system, focusing on these specific technical aspects:

1. **Event Handler Investigation**:
   - Check if the `onDrop` event handlers are being triggered (add console logs)
   - Verify that `preventDefault()` is being called on both dragover and drop events
   - Ensure drop targets have `droppable={true}` or similar attributes set correctly
   - Confirm the drop zones are properly registering the drop event

2. **State Update Issues**:
   - Debug the state update logic that should move tabs between panels
   - Check if the panel/tab state is being correctly modified after a drop event
   - Verify that React is re-rendering after state updates
   - Add console logs to track the full lifecycle of a drop operation

3. **Implementation Approach**:
   - Consider switching to a proven drag and drop library if not already using one:
     * React DnD (react-dnd)
     * react-beautiful-dnd
     * dnd-kit
   - These libraries handle many edge cases and browser compatibility issues

4. **Code Structure Fixes**:
   - Ensure drag and drop handlers are bound correctly to components
   - Check for any stopPropagation() calls that might be preventing event bubbling
   - Verify the data transfer format in the drag operation
   - Make sure component refs are properly maintained during drag operations

5. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Test if drag and drop works in different browsers
   - Check for browser-specific issues with the HTML5 Drag and Drop API

Specific debugging steps:
1. Add console logs before and after all drag/drop event handlers
2. Log the state before and after attempted state updates
3. Check for any errors in the console during drag/drop operations
4. Verify element positions and dimensions during drag operations

I recommend creating a simple test component first that demonstrates working drag and drop functionality between two containers, before integrating it back into the full panel system.
