I'm now getting a specific error when selecting an email after connecting tabs: "[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')" in FlexibleEmailDetailPane.tsx. 

The error is occurring when trying to access properties of an undefined object, specifically related to tag handling in the global context. Please fix this issue by:

1. Adding defensive null checks in the tag handling code:
   - In the code at line 529-530 shown in the error, add null/undefined checks before accessing properties
   - Modify the `globalTags.find()` call to handle cases where objects might be undefined

2. Fix the specific issue in FlexibleEmailDetailPane.tsx:
   ```typescript
   // Replace code like this:
   const globalTag = globalTags.find(t => t.id === tagId);
   
   // With defensive checks like this:
   const globalTag = globalTags && Array.isArray(globalTags) 
     ? globalTags.find(t => t && t.id && t.id === tagId) 
     : undefined;

3. Add proper error handling in the data flow:

4. Wrap the tag processing code in try/catch blocks
Provide fallbacks when tag data isn't available
Add logging to track where the undefined value is coming from


Check the email selection handling:

Ensure the email data is fully loaded before attempting to process tags
Validate any data received through the dependency system
Add a loading state to prevent processing incomplete data



This error is happening specifically when an email selection is made through the dependency system, suggesting there's an issue with how data is being passed or processed when coming through the dependency connection.

This approach targets the specific error you're encountering with the tag handling and provides clear steps to fix the immediate issue. The main problem appears to be accessing properties on undefined objects when an email is selected through the dependency system, which can be solved with proper defensive programming and error handling.RetryClaude can make mistakes.
