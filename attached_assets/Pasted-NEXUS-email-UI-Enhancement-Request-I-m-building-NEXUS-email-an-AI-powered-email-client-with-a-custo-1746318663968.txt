NEXUS.email UI Enhancement Request
I'm building NEXUS.email, an AI-powered email client with a customizable panel system. While I've implemented basic functionality, the UI needs significant refinement to match the polished look of Replit's workspace interface. I need help improving the visual design and user experience of my panel/tab system.
Current Issues
Looking at my current implementation:

The panels look basic and lack proper styling
Tab design is too simple and lacks modern aesthetics
The overall UI feels unpolished compared to Replit's sleek interface
Missing proper spacing, shadows, and visual hierarchy

UI Enhancement Goals

Polish the panel system:

Sleek, subtle borders with proper shadows
Smoother drag handles with visual feedback
Proper spacing between panels
Clean, minimal scrollbars that match the theme


Improve tab design:

Create more modern and minimal tabs similar to the replit workspace ui
Subtle hover and active states
Proper icons with consistent sizing
Clean typography with proper spacing


Overall aesthetic improvements:

Cohesive color scheme with dark mode support
Consistent spacing and alignment
Proper visual hierarchy
Smooth transitions and animations



Recommended Libraries & Tools
Please help me enhance my UI using these modern React libraries:

react-resizable-panels - A lightweight, headless library for resizable panel layouts. It's much more modern and customizable than older alternatives.
Radix UI - Provides unstyled, accessible UI primitives that can be fully customized:

Tabs component for better tab management
Dialog for modal windows
Popover for tooltips and contextual menus


Tailwind CSS - For consistent styling and rapid UI development:

Provides design tokens for spacing, colors, etc.
Makes responsive design easier
Perfect for creating custom component designs


Framer Motion - For smooth animations and transitions:

Panel resize animations
Tab switching effects
Drag and drop visual feedback


Lucide React - Modern, consistent icon set that works well with React and matches Replit's clean aesthetic

Implementation Priorities

First, set up Tailwind CSS and create a cohesive theme system
Replace current panel implementation with react-resizable-panels
Implement Radix UI tabs with custom styling
Add subtle animations with Framer Motion
Polish the overall UI with consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy

Specific UI Elements to Improve

Panel System:

Create sleek, minimal drag handles
Implement smooth resize animations
Add visual feedback during drag operations


Tab Bar:

Create more modern and minimal tabs similar to the replit workspace ui
Add subtle hover and active states
Implement overflow handling for many tabs
Add close buttons and icons


Overall Layout:

Fix spacing inconsistencies
Improve typography hierarchy
Create consistent borders and separators
Polish or remove scrollbars to match the theme
Panels and Tabs should begin with a darker theme aesthetic



Please help me implement these UI improvements to make my NEXUS.email application look as sleek and professional as Replit's interface. I need both the technical implementation and styling guidance to achieve a modern, polished UI.
