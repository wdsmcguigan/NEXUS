## Prompt 5: Component Registry Implementation 

```
For my NEXUS.email application, I need to implement the Component Registry system that will allow all my different features to be available as tabs in any panel. Please help me set up a registry for the following components:

Components to register:
- Accounts Manager
- Inbox List
- Email List (with filter variants: Inbox, Starred, Drafts, etc.)
- Email Content Viewer
- Contact Info Panel
- Tag/Label Manager
- Calendar (both generic and integration-ready)
- Task Manager (both generic and integration-ready)
- Contact Database
- Text Editor
- Notes (both generic and integration-ready)
- Web Browser component
- Mobile Browsing Emulator component
- Email Template Editor
- Application Settings
- Calculator
- Clock (with alarm system) with Integrated Productivity Time-Clock
- File Browser (local)
- File Browser (cloud integrations)

For each component, I need:

1. **Registry Structure**:
   - Create a robust TypeScript interface for component registration
   - Define required metadata and configuration options
   - Set up categories and tagging system for organization

2. **Component Wrapper Implementation**:
   - Create HOC or wrapper components that handle:
     * Consistent tab interface
     * Component-specific toolbars
     * State persistence
     * Search capability integration

3. **Configuration Options**:
   - Define required and optional configuration for each component
   - Create default configurations
   - Support runtime configuration updates

4. **Component Communication**:
   - Enable components to communicate when in different tabs
   - Set up event system for cross-component notifications
   - Handle focus and context awareness

5. **Integration Points**:
   - Define how components integrate with the rest of the application
   - Set up data flow between components
   - Handle component lifecycle events

Please provide a clean implementation of the registry system and examples of registering several key components (Email List, Email Content, Settings). Include TypeScript interfaces, factory methods, and the core registry service.
