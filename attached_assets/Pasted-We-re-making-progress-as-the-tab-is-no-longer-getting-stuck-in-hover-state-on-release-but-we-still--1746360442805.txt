We're making progress as the tab is no longer getting stuck in hover state on release, but we still have a critical issue: dropping a tab on a panel edge isn't creating a new panel, even though the panel edge indicator appears correctly.

Since panel splitting via the context menu works but drag-and-drop splitting doesn't, let's focus on identifying the exact disconnect by:

1. **Compare the working vs. non-working code paths**:
   - Add console.log statements in both the context menu split handler and the drag-drop split handler
   - Trace the entire execution path from event to panel creation
   - Identify exactly where the drag-drop path diverges from the working context menu path

2. **Check event data integrity**:
   - Log the complete event object during the drop on panel edge
   - Verify that all necessary data (tab ID, source panel, target panel, drop position) is available
   - Ensure the drop event contains the correct metadata for processing

3. **Validate the split function call**:
   - Check if the split function is being called at all on drop
   - Verify the parameters passed to the split function are correct
   - Ensure any preconditions for splitting are being met

4. **Test with a simplified approach**:
   - Temporarily modify the drop handler to call exactly the same function as the context menu
   - If this works, then the issue is with how the drop is being processed
   - If it still doesn't work, the issue may be with event handling

5. **Check for errors in the console**:
   - Look for any silent errors that might be preventing panel creation
   - Add try/catch blocks around critical code to catch any exceptions
   - Log any caught errors to understand what might be failing

6. **Test panel creation directly**:
   - Add a test button that calls the panel creation/split function directly
   - If this works but drag-drop doesn't, focus on the event binding issue
   - If neither works, focus on the panel creation logic itself

Please focus exclusively on making the panel edge drop functionality work correctly. This is the final critical piece needed for a complete drag-and-drop experience.
