We're still facing the same persistent issue: when dropping a tab onto a visible panel edge drop zone, no new panel is created. Let's solve this with a more direct approach:

1. **Implement a completely new panel edge drop handler**:
   - Create a fresh implementation of the drop handler for panel edges
   - Do not try to reuse or modify the existing non-working implementation
   - Model it directly after the working context menu split functionality

2. **Explicitly trace the drop sequence with forced debugging**:
   - Add explicit console.log statements at EVERY step of the process:
     * When drag starts (log the tab being dragged)
     * When entering a panel edge zone (log the panel and edge)
     * When the drop occurs (log all relevant data)
     * Before attempting to create the new panel
     * After the panel creation attempt (success or failure)
   - Force these logs to appear in the console regardless of other code execution

3. **Simplify the implementation**:
   - Remove any complex logic or conditions in the drop handler
   - Make the handler as direct as possible: on drop â†’ create panel
   - Avoid any dependencies on complex state or calculations

4. **Add a fail-safe alternative**:
   - If the normal event handling approach continues to fail, implement an alternative:
   - Add explicit DOM event listeners for drop events on panel edges
   - These should directly call the panel creation function
   - Bypass any complex React event handling that might be causing issues

5. **Check for event bubbling or cancellation issues**:
   - Ensure no parent elements are capturing or cancelling the drop event
   - Add event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault() in the right places
   - Log whether the event is reaching the intended handler

I need this functionality to be fixed as it's a critical part of the user experience. If the standard React approach continues to fail, please consider implementing a more direct solution using DOM event listeners or a completely different approach to detect and handle tab drops on panel edges.
